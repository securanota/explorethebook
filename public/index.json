AD 47–48\nKey Themes: Salvation History | Davidic Covenant | Justification by Faith | Gentile Mission\nParallel Passages: Acts 2:14–40 (Peter\u0026rsquo;s Pentecost Sermon) | Romans 1:1–4 | Galatians 3:1–14\nCross-References:\n2 Samuel 7:12–16 | Psalm 2:7 | Psalm 16:10 | Isaiah 49:6 | Isaiah 55:3\nSummary Paul and Barnabas arrive in Pisidian Antioch during their first missionary journey. On the Sabbath, Paul delivers his first recorded sermon—a masterful synthesis of Israel\u0026rsquo;s history demonstrating that Jesus fulfills God\u0026rsquo;s promises to David. The sermon traces God\u0026rsquo;s redemptive plan from the Exodus through David to Jesus, emphasizing that forgiveness comes through Christ alone. The response is initially enthusiastic, with many Jews and Gentiles believing. However, when nearly the entire city gathers the following Sabbath, Jewish leaders oppose Paul and Barnabas, prompting the apostles to formally announce their turn to the Gentiles, citing Isaiah 49:6. Despite persecution and expulsion, the disciples are filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.\nLiterary Context: This passage marks a pivotal transition in Acts. The narrative shifts from Peter to Paul as the dominant figure, from a primarily Jewish audience to an explicitly Gentile mission, and from Jerusalem to the uttermost parts of the earth. This is Paul\u0026rsquo;s inaugural sermon as a commissioned apostle and serves as a theological template for his message to diaspora Jews and God-fearers.\nHistorical Context: Pisidian Antioch was a Roman colony established by Augustus in 25 BC along the Via Sebaste in the province of Galatia. The city enjoyed ius Italicum (full Roman rights) and housed a significant Jewish community alongside Roman colonists. Archaeological excavations have uncovered the Imperial Sanctuary dedicated to Augustus and fragments of the Res Gestae Divi Augusti, underscoring the city\u0026rsquo;s importance as a military and cultural base.\nLiterary Structure \u0026amp; Analysis\rNarrative Framework The passage divides into three major sections:\nI. Journey to Pisidian Antioch (vv. 13–15)\nDeparture from Paphos and arrival in Perga John Mark\u0026rsquo;s departure Travel to Pisidian Antioch Synagogue invitation to speak II. Paul\u0026rsquo;s Synagogue Sermon (vv. 16–41)\nHistorical review: God\u0026rsquo;s faithfulness to Israel (vv. 17–22) Christological proclamation: Jesus as promised Savior (vv. 23–37) Soteriological application: Forgiveness through faith (vv. 38–41) III. Response and Rejection (vv. 42–52)\nInitial positive reception (vv. 42–43) Mass gathering and Jewish opposition (vv. 44–45) Turning to the Gentiles (vv. 46–49) Persecution and expulsion (vv. 50–52) Rhetorical Structure of Paul\u0026rsquo;s Sermon Paul\u0026rsquo;s address follows classical Greco-Roman rhetorical conventions while remaining deeply rooted in Jewish synagogue homiletics:\nExordium (v. 16b): \u0026ldquo;Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen\u0026rdquo;\nDual audience acknowledged: ethnic Jews and God-fearing Gentiles Captatio benevolentiae establishing common ground Narratio (vv. 17–25): Historical foundation tracing God\u0026rsquo;s salvific acts\nEgypt and Exodus (v. 17) Wilderness wandering (v. 18) Conquest of Canaan (v. 19) Period of judges (v. 20) Monarchy: Saul and David (vv. 21–22) John the Baptist as transitional figure (vv. 24–25) Propositio (v. 26): \u0026ldquo;To us the message of this salvation has been sent\u0026rdquo;\nProbatio (vv. 27–37): Evidence for Jesus as Messiah\nFulfillment of prophecy (vv. 27, 29) Resurrection as divine vindication (vv. 30–31) Scriptural proof texts (vv. 32–37) Psalm 2:7 (Davidic sonship) Isaiah 55:3 (sure mercies of David) Psalm 16:10 (no decay) Peroratio (vv. 38–41): Application and warning\nProclamation of forgiveness (vv. 38–39) Prophetic warning from Habakkuk 1:5 (vv. 40–41) Theological Center The sermon\u0026rsquo;s theological climax occurs in verses 32–37, where Paul establishes the resurrection of Jesus as the fulfillment of three key Old Testament passages. The argument hinges on the contrast between David, who \u0026ldquo;saw corruption,\u0026rdquo; and Jesus, who did not—demonstrating Jesus as David\u0026rsquo;s greater Son and the eternal heir to the throne.\nChiastic Elements Scholars have identified chiastic patterns in Acts 13–14 as a whole, with this Pisidian Antioch episode forming the literary and theological centerpoint. Within the sermon itself, there is a parallel structure:\nA – God\u0026rsquo;s election and deliverance of Israel (v. 17)\nB – Rejection of Saul, establishment of David (vv. 21–22)\nC – Jesus brought as promised Savior (v. 23)\nB\u0026rsquo; – Rejection of Jesus, vindication through resurrection (vv. 27–31)\nA\u0026rsquo; – Promise fulfilled for \u0026ldquo;us\u0026rdquo; (the new people of God) (vv. 32–33)\nHistorical Cultural Context\rGeography and Urban Setting Pisidian Antioch (modern Yalvaç, Turkey) sat on a strategic plateau approximately 3,600 feet above sea level in the Taurus mountain range. The city controlled the Via Sebaste, the main military road connecting Ephesus to the Euphrates. Augustus refounded it as Colonia Caesarea Antiocheia around 25 BC, settling military veterans there to maintain Roman control over the volatile region of Pisidia.\nArchaeological evidence reveals:\nAn imperial cult temple (Augusteum) dedicated to the goddess Cybele and the emperor Remains of a monumental gateway celebrating Septimius Severus\u0026rsquo;s victory over the Parthians Latin inscriptions confirming the city\u0026rsquo;s status and Roman character A significant aqueduct system supporting a population of 20,000–30,000 The Jewish Community While Pisidian Antioch was predominantly Roman and pagan, Josephus (Antiquities 14.115) attests to a substantial Jewish presence in the region. Jewish communities in Asia Minor often enjoyed certain privileges granted by Roman authorities, including:\nFreedom to observe Sabbath and festivals Exemption from military service Right to collect Temple tax Autonomy in legal matters affecting Jewish law The synagogue congregation would have included:\nEthnic Jews (descendants of Hellenistic-era settlers) Proselytes (full converts to Judaism) God-fearers (σεβόμενοι/φοβούμενοι τὸν θεόν) – Gentiles who attended synagogue, observed some Jewish practices, but had not fully converted This third category is crucial for understanding the sermon\u0026rsquo;s dual audience and the subsequent Gentile response.\nSynagogue Worship Structure First-century synagogue services followed a recognizable pattern:\nShema and prayers (including the Shemoneh Esreh/Eighteen Benedictions) Reading from the Torah (following a lectionary cycle) Reading from the Prophets (Haftarah) Sermon/exposition (דְּרָשָׁה, derashah) Benediction The \u0026ldquo;word of exhortation\u0026rdquo; (λόγος παρακλήσεως, v. 15) was typically delivered by a qualified visitor or learned member. Paul, as a trained Pharisee and student of Gamaliel (Acts 22:3), was eminently qualified. His sermon would have followed the pesher method of interpretation—connecting current events to scriptural prophecy.\nImperial Cult and Competing \u0026ldquo;Gospels\u0026rdquo; The city\u0026rsquo;s imperial temple and the presence of the Res Gestae Divi Augusti inscription created an ideological backdrop for Paul\u0026rsquo;s preaching. Rome proclaimed the emperor\u0026rsquo;s birth and rule as εὐαγγέλιον (\u0026ldquo;good news\u0026rdquo;), promising peace and prosperity. The Priene Inscription (9 BC) declares Augustus\u0026rsquo;s birthday as \u0026ldquo;good news for the world.\u0026rdquo;\nPaul\u0026rsquo;s counter-proclamation of Jesus as Lord and Savior would have been heard as both religiously provocative to Jews and politically subversive to Roman authorities—a \u0026ldquo;gospel\u0026rdquo; competing with imperial propaganda.\nDating and Historical Reliability Most scholars date Paul\u0026rsquo;s first missionary journey to AD 47–48, approximately 14–17 years after Jesus\u0026rsquo; crucifixion. This chronology fits with:\nThe famine relief visit (Acts 11:27–30) during Claudius\u0026rsquo;s reign The proconsulship of Sergius Paulus in Cyprus (corroborated by inscriptional evidence) Paul\u0026rsquo;s later claim in Galatians 2:1 of returning to Jerusalem \u0026ldquo;after fourteen years\u0026rdquo; The historical details in Acts 13—the Via Sebaste route, the presence of synagogues, the dual audience of Jews and God-fearers—all align with archaeological and literary evidence from the period.\nExegetical Commentary: Verse-by-Verse Analysis\rVerses 13–15: Setting the Stage Verse 13 \u0026ldquo;Now Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. And John left them and returned to Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\nTextual Notes: The shift from \u0026ldquo;Barnabas and Saul\u0026rdquo; (13:2, 7) to \u0026ldquo;Paul and his companions\u0026rdquo; marks a significant narrative transition. From this point forward, Paul assumes leadership of the mission. The Western text (Codex Bezae) adds explanatory material here, but the shorter reading is strongly supported by 𝔓⁴⁵ ℵ A B.\n\u0026ldquo;Paul and his companions\u0026rdquo; (Παῦλος δὲ καὶ οἱ περὶ αὐτόν) – This construction (οἱ περὶ + accusative) typically denotes a leader and his entourage. Luke signals Paul\u0026rsquo;s emerging prominence.\n\u0026ldquo;John left them\u0026rdquo; (Ἰωάννης ἀποχωρήσας) – The verb ἀποχωρέω suggests withdrawal or separation, possibly with negative connotation. Luke does not explain John Mark\u0026rsquo;s departure, but Acts 15:38 reveals it caused significant conflict between Paul and Barnabas. Possible reasons proposed by scholars:\nFear of dangers ahead (Pisidian highlands were notorious for bandits) Disagreement with Paul\u0026rsquo;s leadership Discomfort with the increasingly Gentile focus Family obligations (John Mark was Barnabas\u0026rsquo;s cousin; Col 4:10) Theological Significance: The departure foreshadows the cost of mission and highlights human frailty even within apostolic circles. Yet God\u0026rsquo;s purposes advance despite human weakness.\nVerse 14 \u0026ldquo;But they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia. And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.\u0026rdquo;\nGeographical Note: The journey from Perga to Pisidian Antioch covered approximately 100 miles through mountainous terrain, ascending over 3,000 feet. Some scholars suggest Paul\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;thorn in the flesh\u0026rdquo; (2 Cor 12:7) may have been contracted during this difficult trek, perhaps malaria from the coastal lowlands.\n\u0026ldquo;Antioch in Pisidia\u0026rdquo; (Ἀντιόχειαν τὴν Πισιδίαν) – More precisely \u0026ldquo;Antioch toward Pisidia,\u0026rdquo; as the city was technically in Phrygia but near the Pisidian border. There were multiple cities named Antioch in the Seleucid Empire; Luke specifies location.\n\u0026ldquo;They went into the synagogue\u0026rdquo; – This becomes Paul\u0026rsquo;s consistent missionary strategy: \u0026ldquo;to the Jew first\u0026rdquo; (Rom 1:16). The synagogue provided a ready audience already familiar with Scripture, monotheism, and messianic expectation.\n\u0026ldquo;Sat down\u0026rdquo; (ἐκάθισαν) – The seated posture was typical for listeners; teachers stood to read but often sat to expound (cf. Luke 4:20). This detail suggests they waited to be invited to speak.\nVerse 15 \u0026ldquo;After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent a message to them, saying, \u0026lsquo;Brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, say it.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nSynagogue Structure: The \u0026ldquo;rulers\u0026rdquo; (ἀρχισυνάγωγοι) were officials responsible for organizing worship, maintaining the building, and selecting speakers. Their invitation shows Paul and Barnabas were recognized as learned Jews qualified to teach.\n\u0026ldquo;Word of encouragement\u0026rdquo; (λόγος παρακλήσεως) – The term παράκλησις encompasses comfort, exhortation, and encouragement. This technical phrase for the synagogue sermon appears also in Hebrews 13:22. The invitation was routine for visiting teachers.\nWhat Scripture was read? Though not specified, some scholars suggest the Torah reading may have included passages about David (given Paul\u0026rsquo;s focus) or the Exodus (which Paul begins with). The prophetic reading possibly included passages Paul would later cite (Psalms, Isaiah).\nVerses 16–41: Paul\u0026rsquo;s Sermon Verse 16 \u0026ldquo;So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said: \u0026lsquo;Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nPhysical Gesture: The hand motion (κατασείσας τῇ χειρί) is the same gesture used by Paul in Acts 21:40 and by Peter in Acts 12:17. It was a conventional rhetorical gesture to gain attention and signal the beginning of a formal address.\nDual Address: Paul\u0026rsquo;s opening acknowledges two distinct groups:\n\u0026ldquo;Men of Israel\u0026rdquo; (Ἄνδρες Ἰσραηλῖται) – Ethnic Jews, heirs of the covenant \u0026ldquo;You who fear God\u0026rdquo; (οἱ φοβούμενοι τὸν θεόν) – God-fearing Gentiles attached to the synagogue This inclusive address is repeated in verse 26, framing the sermon\u0026rsquo;s core message. It demonstrates Paul\u0026rsquo;s awareness of his mixed audience and anticipates the Gentile mission.\n\u0026ldquo;Listen\u0026rdquo; (ἀκούσατε) – An imperative echoing the Shema (Deut 6:4: \u0026ldquo;Hear, O Israel\u0026rdquo;). Paul positions himself in the prophetic tradition calling Israel to attention.\nVerses 17–22: Historical Foundation Verse 17: \u0026ldquo;The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it.\u0026rdquo;\nTheological Theme: Election and Exodus\nPaul begins with God\u0026rsquo;s electing love (ἐξελέξατο, from ἐκλέγομαι) – a crucial theme in Israel\u0026rsquo;s self-understanding (Deut 7:6–8). The verb \u0026ldquo;chose\u0026rdquo; appears first, emphasizing divine initiative. God acts before Israel responds.\n\u0026ldquo;Made the people great\u0026rdquo; (ὕψωσεν τὸν λαόν) – Literally \u0026ldquo;exalted the people.\u0026rdquo; This refers to Israel\u0026rsquo;s multiplication in Egypt (Exod 1:7), but the verb carries theological weight: God elevates the lowly. The same root (ὑψόω) is used for Jesus\u0026rsquo; exaltation in John 12:32.\n\u0026ldquo;With uplifted arm\u0026rdquo; (μετὰ βραχίονος ὑψηλοῦ) – A stock phrase from Exodus tradition (Exod 6:6; Deut 5:15; Ps 136:12), emphasizing God\u0026rsquo;s power in liberation. The \u0026ldquo;high arm\u0026rdquo; imagery evoked God as divine warrior fighting for his people.\nHomiletical Pattern: Paul follows a classic recital pattern found throughout Scripture (Deut 6:20–25; 26:5–9; Josh 24:2–13; Neh 9:6–37; Ps 78, 105, 106). Recounting God\u0026rsquo;s mighty acts grounds present faith in historical demonstration of God\u0026rsquo;s faithfulness.\nVerse 18: \u0026ldquo;And for about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.\u0026rdquo;\nTextual Variant: A significant variant exists here. The critical text (NA28, following 𝔓⁷⁴ ℵ A B) reads ἐτροποφόρησεν (\u0026ldquo;he bore with them\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;endured their manner\u0026rdquo;). The Byzantine text reads ἐτροφοφόρησεν (\u0026ldquo;he nourished them\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;cared for them as a nurse\u0026rdquo;). The variants differ by only one letter (π vs φ).\nExternal Evidence: Favors \u0026ldquo;bore with\u0026rdquo; (𝔓⁷⁴ is the earliest witness, c. AD 175–225) Internal Evidence: \u0026ldquo;Bore with\u0026rdquo; fits the wilderness narrative\u0026rsquo;s theme of rebellion (Num 14:33–34; Deut 1:31; Acts 7:36). Yet \u0026ldquo;nourished\u0026rdquo; also has biblical support (Deut 1:31 LXX uses τροφοφορέω).\nInterpretation: If \u0026ldquo;bore with,\u0026rdquo; Paul emphasizes Israel\u0026rsquo;s persistent rebellion and God\u0026rsquo;s patience—a warning to his current audience (cf. v. 40). If \u0026ldquo;nourished,\u0026rdquo; the emphasis falls on God\u0026rsquo;s sustaining grace. Most modern translations prefer \u0026ldquo;put up with\u0026rdquo; based on manuscript evidence and contextual fit with the warning of verses 40–41.\nForty years – Round number representing a generation (Num 14:33–34; 32:13).\nVerses 19–20: Conquest and Settlement Verse 19: \u0026ldquo;And after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Seven nations\u0026rdquo; – Standard Deuteronomic formula (Deut 7:1; Josh 3:10) for the pre-Israelite inhabitants: Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.\n\u0026ldquo;Destroying\u0026rdquo; (καθελών) – From καθαιρέω, \u0026ldquo;to pull down, demolish.\u0026rdquo; The verb appears in 2 Cor 10:4 regarding spiritual warfare. Paul uses conquest language but attributes the victory entirely to God as subject—\u0026quot;he destroyed,\u0026quot; \u0026ldquo;he gave.\u0026rdquo; Israel\u0026rsquo;s role is minimized; God\u0026rsquo;s agency is paramount.\n\u0026ldquo;As an inheritance\u0026rdquo; (κατακληροδοτέω) – Legal term for distributing property by lot. Theologically loaded: the land is both gift (grace) and inheritance (covenant promise). This vocabulary connects to Paul\u0026rsquo;s later theology of believers as heirs (Rom 8:17; Gal 3:29).\nVerse 20: \u0026ldquo;All this took about 450 years. And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.\u0026rdquo;\nChronological Problem: This verse contains one of the most discussed textual and chronological issues in Acts.\nTextual Variant in v. 20: Manuscripts differ on where to place \u0026ldquo;about 450 years\u0026rdquo;:\nVariant 1 (followed by KJV, Byzantine text): \u0026ldquo;And after that he gave them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.\u0026rdquo;\nSuggests 450 years of judges Variant 2 (followed by modern translations, based on 𝔓⁷⁴ ℵ A B): \u0026ldquo;All this took about 450 years. After this, God gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.\u0026rdquo;\nSuggests 450 years covers the period from Egyptian bondage through conquest Chronological Calculation:\nEgyptian sojourn: ~400 years (Gen 15:13; Acts 7:6) Wilderness: 40 years Conquest: ~10 years Total: ~450 years This reading (Variant 2) has stronger manuscript support and resolves the chronological difficulty, as the period of judges in the Old Testament does not appear to span 450 years. The 450 years encompasses the entire period from Egypt to the establishment of the monarchy.\n\u0026ldquo;Judges until Samuel\u0026rdquo; – Samuel functions as transitional figure between the judges and the monarchy (1 Sam 7–8). He was the last judge and first prophet of the monarchic period.\nTheological Themes\r1. The Davidic Covenant and Messianic Fulfillment The theological heart of Paul\u0026rsquo;s sermon is the claim that Jesus is the fulfillment of God\u0026rsquo;s promise to David (vv. 22–23, 32–37). This is the first explicit connection Paul makes between Jesus and the Davidic covenant in Acts.\nFoundation: 2 Samuel 7:12–16 God\u0026rsquo;s promise to David included:\nAn eternal dynasty (\u0026ldquo;your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever\u0026rdquo;) A son who would build the temple A father-son relationship between God and David\u0026rsquo;s heir Discipline but not rejection Paul\u0026rsquo;s Argument:\nGod chose David as \u0026ldquo;a man after my heart\u0026rdquo; (v. 22, quoting 1 Sam 13:14 + Ps 89:20) \u0026ldquo;From this man\u0026rsquo;s descendants\u0026rdquo; God brought Jesus as Savior (v. 23) The resurrection proves Jesus is the eternal Son (v. 33, citing Ps 2:7) The \u0026ldquo;holy and sure blessings of David\u0026rdquo; (v. 34, citing Isa 55:3) are guaranteed through one who does not see corruption David died and saw corruption; Jesus rose and did not (vv. 36–37, citing Ps 16:10) Theological Significance: The Davidic covenant was unconditional—God\u0026rsquo;s faithfulness did not depend on Israel\u0026rsquo;s obedience. Yet it required an eternal heir, which necessitated a descendant who would not die or, if he died, would be raised. Paul identifies Jesus as this eternal heir, making the resurrection central to covenant fulfillment.\nThis theme connects to Paul\u0026rsquo;s later writings:\nRomans 1:3–4: Jesus \u0026ldquo;descended from David according to the flesh\u0026rdquo; but \u0026ldquo;declared to be the Son of God in power\u0026hellip;by his resurrection\u0026rdquo; 2 Timothy 2:8: \u0026ldquo;Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descended from David\u0026rdquo; 2. Salvation History (Heilsgeschichte) Paul presents God\u0026rsquo;s work in Jesus as the climax of a continuous redemptive narrative. The sermon traces God\u0026rsquo;s salvific actions:\nPast → Present → Future\nGod\u0026rsquo;s electing love (Egypt, Exodus) God\u0026rsquo;s patient endurance (Wilderness) God\u0026rsquo;s gift of land and judges God\u0026rsquo;s establishment of monarchy (David) God\u0026rsquo;s sending of Savior (Jesus) God\u0026rsquo;s offer of forgiveness (now) God\u0026rsquo;s warning of judgment (future, v. 41) This recital pattern serves multiple purposes:\nEstablishes continuity: Christianity is not abandoning Judaism but fulfilling it Demonstrates God\u0026rsquo;s character: Faithful to promises despite human failure Creates expectation: If God acted decisively in the past, trust him now Calls for response: You are part of this story—how will you respond? 3. Justification by Faith (vv. 38–39) Verse 38–39: \u0026ldquo;Let it be known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is the clearest statement of justification theology in Acts, anticipating Romans and Galatians:\nKey Elements:\na) Forgiveness (ἄφεσις ἁμαρτιῶν)\nForgiveness of sins is proclaimed (καταγγέλλεται) – it is gospel, good news It comes \u0026ldquo;through this man\u0026rdquo; (διὰ τούτου) – exclusively through Jesus It is offered to \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rdquo; – both Jews and God-fearers b) Freedom/Justification (δικαιόω)\n\u0026ldquo;Everyone who believes is freed/justified\u0026rdquo; (πᾶς ὁ πιστεύων δικαιοῦται) Justified \u0026ldquo;from everything\u0026rdquo; (ἀπὸ πάντων) – comprehensive forgiveness \u0026ldquo;From which you could not be freed by the law of Moses\u0026rdquo; (ὧν οὐκ ἠδυνήθητε ἐν νόμῳ Μωϋσέως δικαιωθῆναι) The Law\u0026rsquo;s Limitation: Paul does not say the law was bad but that it could not accomplish what Jesus does. The verb \u0026ldquo;could not\u0026rdquo; (ἠδυνήθητε, from δύναμαι) emphasizes inability, not mere difficulty. The law revealed sin, prescribed atonement, but could not provide the ultimate sacrifice and new heart necessary for righteousness.\nRelationship to Paul\u0026rsquo;s Letters:\nRomans 3:20: \u0026ldquo;By works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight\u0026rdquo; Galatians 2:16: \u0026ldquo;A person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ\u0026rdquo; Galatians 3:10–14: The law brings a curse; Christ redeems from the curse Theological Debate: Does Acts 13:39 teach that the law provides partial justification and Jesus provides the rest? Or complete inability of the law to justify?\nThe Greek construction (ἀπὸ πάντων ὧν οὐκ ἠδυνήθητε) suggests the latter: \u0026ldquo;from all things from which you were not able in the law of Moses to be justified.\u0026rdquo; The law could not justify from any of these things; Jesus justifies from all of them.\n4. The Gentile Mission and Isaiah 49:6 Verse 47: \u0026ldquo;For so the Lord has commanded us: \u0026lsquo;I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nPaul and Barnabas quote Isaiah 49:6, a Servant Song originally addressed to Israel as God\u0026rsquo;s servant. The application is revolutionary:\nOriginal Context (Isaiah 49:1–6):\nThe Servant is called from the womb The Servant will restore Israel But restoration of Israel is \u0026ldquo;too light a thing\u0026rdquo; Therefore, the Servant will be \u0026ldquo;a light for the nations\u0026rdquo; The Servant will bring God\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;salvation to the end of the earth\u0026rdquo; Paul\u0026rsquo;s Application: By applying this to their own mission, Paul and Barnabas claim:\nThey are fulfilling Israel\u0026rsquo;s vocation as light to nations The mission to Gentiles is not a backup plan but God\u0026rsquo;s intention from the beginning Rejection by some Jews does not nullify God\u0026rsquo;s purposes Theological Implications:\nThe church (Jewish and Gentile believers) inherits Israel\u0026rsquo;s mission Geographic expansion (\u0026ldquo;ends of the earth\u0026rdquo;) is covenant fulfillment, not covenant replacement Isaiah\u0026rsquo;s vision of universal salvation is being realized in the gospel This theme becomes central to Acts:\nActs 1:8: \u0026ldquo;You will be my witnesses\u0026hellip;to the end of the earth\u0026rdquo; Acts 15:14–18: James cites Amos 9:11–12 to defend Gentile inclusion Acts 28:28: Paul\u0026rsquo;s final words declare salvation sent to Gentiles Homiletical \u0026amp; Pastoral Application\rPreaching Outline Title: \u0026ldquo;The Gospel According to Paul: God\u0026rsquo;s Unfinished Story Finds Its Climax\u0026rdquo;\nI. God\u0026rsquo;s Faithfulness to His Promises (vv. 17–25) A. He chose us when we had nothing to offer B. He delivered us when we were enslaved C. He sustained us when we rebelled D. He prepared the way for the ultimate Deliverer\nII. God\u0026rsquo;s Provision of the Perfect Savior (vv. 26–37) A. Jesus fulfills the Davidic promise B. Jesus conquers death itself C. Jesus accomplishes what the law could not\nIII. God\u0026rsquo;s Offer of Complete Forgiveness (vv. 38–39) A. Proclaimed freely to all who will listen B. Received through faith alone C. Provides what religious effort cannot\nIV. God\u0026rsquo;s Warning Against Unbelief (vv. 40–41) A. The danger of familiarity with Scripture without faith B. The tragedy of rejecting what God is doing in your midst C. The urgency of responding today\nTeaching Applications 1. For Evangelism: Paul\u0026rsquo;s sermon provides a model for gospel presentation that:\nGrounds the gospel in the grand narrative of Scripture Demonstrates Jesus as the fulfillment of God\u0026rsquo;s ancient promises Offers free forgiveness through faith Warns of the consequences of rejection Modern Application: When sharing faith with those familiar with the Bible (cultural Christians, those with religious background), follow Paul\u0026rsquo;s method:\nConnect Jesus to the bigger story they already know Show how Jesus completes what religious ritual cannot Emphasize the free offer of grace 2. For Understanding Scripture: Paul reads the entire Old Testament as pointing toward Christ. This is not allegory but typology—seeing patterns of God\u0026rsquo;s redemptive work that find their fullest expression in Jesus.\nPractical Steps:\nWhen reading Old Testament narratives, ask: \u0026ldquo;How does this reveal God\u0026rsquo;s character and redemptive purposes?\u0026rdquo; Look for themes that recur and intensify: deliverance, sacrifice, covenant, kingdom Recognize that Jesus is the \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; to all God\u0026rsquo;s promises (2 Cor 1:20) 3. For Pastoral Care: The sermon\u0026rsquo;s emphasis on God\u0026rsquo;s patience (v. 18—\u0026ldquo;he put up with them\u0026rdquo;) offers comfort:\nGod knows our weaknesses and failures His purposes are not derailed by our stumbling He has been dealing with stubborn people from the beginning—and he doesn\u0026rsquo;t give up Pastoral Counsel: When believers are discouraged by their own failures or the church\u0026rsquo;s imperfections, remind them of God\u0026rsquo;s long track record of working through flawed people to accomplish his purposes.\n4. For Mission and Outreach: The response to rejection (vv. 46–47) teaches:\nClosed doors with one group mean open doors with another Rejection of the gospel by some is not failure but part of the pattern Bold proclamation despite opposition is Spirit-empowered obedience Missional Challenge: Are we willing to pivot when God closes one door and opens another? Do we limit God\u0026rsquo;s work to our preferred audience, or follow his leading to unexpected people groups?\nContemporary Connections 1. The Inadequacy of Religion vs. Relationship (v. 39) In an era of \u0026ldquo;spiritual but not religious\u0026rdquo; sentiment, Paul\u0026rsquo;s message resonates: religious observance (even God-given law) cannot produce the transformation only Jesus provides. Yet Paul doesn\u0026rsquo;t abandon religious structure—he shows its proper place as pointing to Christ.\nCultural Conversation: Many reject \u0026ldquo;organized religion\u0026rdquo; but still seek meaning and forgiveness. Paul affirms the longing while pointing beyond ritual to relationship with the living Christ.\n2. The Scandal of Particularity Paul\u0026rsquo;s claim that forgiveness comes exclusively \u0026ldquo;through this man\u0026rdquo; (v. 38) confronts modern pluralism. Yet the invitation is universal: \u0026ldquo;everyone who believes\u0026rdquo; (v. 39).\nApologetic Approach: The gospel is simultaneously exclusive (one way) and inclusive (offered to all). No one is excluded by ethnicity, background, or past—only by unbelief.\n3. Joy Despite Persecution (v. 52) \u0026ldquo;And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit\u0026rdquo; immediately after being persecuted and expelled models a counter-cultural response.\nApplication: Joy is not circumstance-dependent but Spirit-given. The early church\u0026rsquo;s joy came from:\nKnowing they were right with God (justification) Experiencing God\u0026rsquo;s presence (Spirit) Participating in God\u0026rsquo;s mission (witnesses) Challenge: Our culture equates happiness with comfort. The gospel offers joy that transcends circumstances—but it must be actively cultivated through worship, community, and mission.\nWarnings and Challenges From verse 40–41 (Hab 1:5): \u0026ldquo;Beware, therefore, lest what is said in the Prophets should come about: \u0026lsquo;Look, you scoffers, be astounded and perish; for I am doing a work in your days, a work that you will not believe, even if one tells it to you.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nWarning 1: The Danger of Scoffing Religious people can be so familiar with Scripture that they miss what God is actually doing. The greatest opponents of Jesus were those who knew the Bible best but rejected its fulfillment.\nSelf-Examination: Do I approach Scripture seeking God, or merely confirming what I already believe? Am I open to God doing a \u0026ldquo;new thing\u0026rdquo; even if it challenges my expectations?\nWarning 2: The Urgency of Response Paul doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow indefinite contemplation. The offer is made; response is required. Delay is a form of decision.\nPastoral Application: In counseling and evangelism, there comes a moment when the question must be pressed: \u0026ldquo;What will you do with Jesus?\u0026rdquo; Endless investigation can become evasion.\nWarning 3: The Possibility of Being Left Behind The Jews who reject the gospel are not stopped from God\u0026rsquo;s purposes—they simply forfeit their participation. The mission continues; Gentiles believe; the kingdom advances.\nCorporate Implication: Churches and movements that reject what God is doing may be bypassed. Institutional preservation is no guarantee of God\u0026rsquo;s presence. God raises up new instruments when old ones become brittle.\nOriginal Language Insights\rKey Greek Terms and Phrases 1. ἀφορίσατε (v. 2) → Leadership transition Though not in this passage, the leadership shift from Barnabas to Paul reflects the earlier \u0026ldquo;setting apart\u0026rdquo; (ἀφορίζω) in 13:2. The verb means to mark off boundaries, separate for specific purpose. Paul later uses it of his own calling (Rom 1:1; Gal 1:15).\n2. ἀποχωρήσας (v. 13) – \u0026ldquo;departed, withdrew\u0026rdquo; John Mark\u0026rsquo;s departure uses ἀποχωρέω, suggesting separation with potential negative overtone. The same root appears in Matt 7:23 (\u0026ldquo;depart from me\u0026rdquo;) and 2 Cor 12:8 (thorn \u0026ldquo;leave me\u0026rdquo;). Luke\u0026rsquo;s neutral reporting allows readers to draw conclusions, but Acts 15:38 confirms this was viewed negatively by Paul.\n3. λόγος παρακλήσεως (v. 15) – \u0026ldquo;word of exhortation\u0026rdquo; λόγος = word, message, discourse παράκλησις = encouragement, comfort, exhortation, appeal This technical phrase for synagogue sermon appears also in Heb 13:22. The noun παράκλησις is related to παράκλητος (\u0026ldquo;advocate, comforter\u0026rdquo;)—the title Jesus gives the Holy Spirit (John 14:16, 26). A sermon should comfort, challenge, and call forth response.\n4. ἐξελέξατο (v. 17) – \u0026ldquo;chose, elected\u0026rdquo; From ἐκλέγομαι, this is foundational vocabulary for divine election. Used throughout Scripture for God\u0026rsquo;s sovereign choice:\nIsrael as chosen people (Deut 7:6 LXX) David as chosen king (Ps 78:70 LXX) The Twelve apostles (Luke 6:13) Believers as elect (Eph 1:4) Theological Weight: Paul begins with God\u0026rsquo;s initiative. Before Israel did anything, God chose. Before we respond, God acts. Election precedes response.\n5. ὕψωσεν (v. 17) – \u0026ldquo;exalted, lifted up\u0026rdquo; From ὑψόω, literally \u0026ldquo;to lift high.\u0026rdquo; Double meaning:\nPhysical: Israel grew numerous in Egypt Theological: God elevates the lowly Ironic Parallel: The same verb describes Jesus\u0026rsquo; crucifixion and exaltation (John 3:14; 8:28; 12:32–34; Acts 2:33; 5:31). God exalts through humiliation—a pattern for Israel in Egypt and Jesus on the cross.\n6. ἐτροποφόρησεν / ἐτροφοφόρησεν (v. 18) – Textual Variant ἐτροποφόρησεν (tropos + phoreo) = \u0026ldquo;bore their manner,\u0026rdquo; i.e., endured/tolerated ἐτροφοφόρησεν (trophē + phoreo) = \u0026ldquo;bore them as nurse,\u0026rdquo; i.e., nourished/cared for One-letter difference (π vs φ) changes meaning significantly:\nIf \u0026ldquo;endured\u0026rdquo;: emphasizes Israel\u0026rsquo;s rebellion and God\u0026rsquo;s patience If \u0026ldquo;nourished\u0026rdquo;: emphasizes God\u0026rsquo;s tender care despite rebellion Decision: External evidence (𝔓⁷⁴ ℵ A B) supports \u0026ldquo;endured.\u0026rdquo; Internal evidence: fits context of warning (vv. 40–41) about not repeating Israel\u0026rsquo;s pattern. Deut 1:31 LXX uses τροφοφορέω, but the wilderness generation was marked by unbelief (Heb 3:7–19).\nTranslation: Most modern versions: \u0026ldquo;put up with them\u0026rdquo; (ESV, NIV, NRSV)\n7. καθελών (v. 19) – \u0026ldquo;having destroyed\u0026rdquo; From καθαιρέω: to pull down, demolish, destroy. Aorist active participle showing completed action.\nConquest Theology: God as divine warrior fighting for Israel. Not human military might but divine intervention accounts for victory.\nNT Usage elsewhere:\nLuke 1:52: God \u0026ldquo;has brought down the mighty from their thrones\u0026rdquo; 2 Cor 10:4–5: weapons to \u0026ldquo;destroy strongholds\u0026hellip;arguments\u0026hellip;against knowledge of God\u0026rdquo; Theological Transfer: Just as God destroyed Israel\u0026rsquo;s enemies to give inheritance, Jesus destroys spiritual enemies (sin, death, Satan) to give us eternal inheritance.\n8. κατακληροδοτέω (v. 19) – \u0026ldquo;gave as inheritance by lot\u0026rdquo; Compound verb: κατά (down, according to) + κληροδοτέω (to give by lot/inheritance)\nRare word (only here in NT). The κλῆρος word group relates to:\nLot, portion (Acts 1:26—casting lots) Inheritance (Col 1:12; 1 Pet 1:4) Clergy (from κλῆρος, those chosen by lot/divine calling) Theological Significance: Land distribution by lot emphasized divine sovereignty in apportionment. No tribe could claim superiority—each received their portion from God\u0026rsquo;s hand. Applied spiritually: Our inheritance in Christ is assigned by grace, not merit.\n9. ἀνήγαγεν (v. 22) – \u0026ldquo;raised up\u0026rdquo; From ἀνάγω: to lead up, bring up, raise. Used for:\nRaising up leaders (here, David; also v. 23, Jesus) Bringing forth from death (Rom 10:7) Offering sacrifice (James 2:21) Davidic Raising: God removed Saul and \u0026ldquo;raised up\u0026rdquo; (ἀνήγαγεν) David. The same verb is used for raising Jesus (v. 23) and raising him from the dead (vv. 30, 33, 34).\nPattern: God removes the inadequate and raises up the sufficient. God removes the law\u0026rsquo;s inability and raises up the perfect Savior.\n10. σωτῆρα (v. 23) – \u0026ldquo;Savior\u0026rdquo; From σωτήρ: savior, deliverer, preserver.\nBackground:\nOT Usage: God is Israel\u0026rsquo;s Savior (Isa 43:3, 11; 45:15, 21 LXX) Greco-Roman Usage: Emperors and gods called \u0026ldquo;savior\u0026rdquo; (σωτήρ inscriptions abound) NT Usage: Applied to both God the Father and Jesus Subversive Claim: In a city honoring Augustus with temples and inscriptions, Paul proclaims a different σωτήρ—not Caesar but Jesus. This \u0026ldquo;Savior\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t bring pax Romana through military might but forgiveness through sacrificial death.\nSalvation Terminology:\nσωτήρ (Savior) – the person σωτηρία (salvation) – the state/act (v. 26, 47) σῴζω (to save) – the action 11. κατὰ σάρκα (v. 23) – \u0026ldquo;according to the flesh\u0026rdquo; Though not in all manuscripts, many include this phrase modifying \u0026ldquo;descendants\u0026rdquo; (σπέρματος).\nPauline Usage:\nRom 1:3: Jesus \u0026ldquo;descended from David according to the flesh\u0026rdquo; Rom 9:5: Israel \u0026ldquo;according to the flesh\u0026rdquo; are forefathers of Christ Gal 4:23, 29: Ishmael born \u0026ldquo;according to the flesh,\u0026rdquo; Isaac \u0026ldquo;according to the Spirit\u0026rdquo; Implication: Jesus\u0026rsquo; Davidic descent is real but not the whole story. \u0026ldquo;According to flesh\u0026rdquo; needs to be balanced by \u0026ldquo;according to Spirit\u0026rdquo; (resurrection and divine sonship).\n12. ἠγνόησαν (v. 27) – \u0026ldquo;did not recognize\u0026rdquo; From ἀγνοέω: to be ignorant, not know, fail to recognize.\nIrony: Those who read the prophets every Sabbath (τὰς φωνὰς τῶν προφητῶν) failed to recognize their fulfillment in Jesus. Familiarity with Scripture ≠ understanding Scripture.\nTheological Depth: Ignorance does not excuse (they \u0026ldquo;fulfilled\u0026rdquo; the prophecies by condemning Jesus) but it does explain and offers hope—Peter will appeal to ignorance for forgiveness in Acts 3:17.\nPaul\u0026rsquo;s own experience: He persecuted Christians in ignorance and unbelief (1 Tim 1:13). Hence mercy.\n13. ἐτέλεσαν (v. 29) – \u0026ldquo;they had fulfilled\u0026rdquo; From τελέω: to complete, finish, fulfill, accomplish.\nScriptural Fulfillment: Unwittingly, those who condemned Jesus \u0026ldquo;fulfilled all that was written.\u0026rdquo; God\u0026rsquo;s sovereignty works through human action—even sinful rejection—to accomplish his purposes.\nParallels:\nActs 4:27–28: Herod, Pilate, Gentiles gathered \u0026ldquo;to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined\u0026rdquo; John 19:28–30: Jesus says \u0026ldquo;It is finished\u0026rdquo; (τετέλεσται) when all is accomplished 14. πεποίηκεν (v. 33) – \u0026ldquo;has fulfilled\u0026rdquo; From ποιέω: to do, make, fulfill. Perfect tense: completed action with ongoing results.\nPromise Fulfillment: \u0026ldquo;God has fulfilled (perfect tense) this to us\u0026rdquo; – it is done and stands accomplished. The resurrection is not promise but fulfillment, not hope but historical fact.\n15. υἱός μου εἶ σύ (v. 33) – \u0026ldquo;You are my Son\u0026rdquo; Citation of Psalm 2:7: \u0026ldquo;You are my Son; today I have begotten you.\u0026rdquo;\nMessianic Psalm: Psalm 2 was understood as Davidic coronation liturgy with messianic overtones. \u0026ldquo;Today\u0026rdquo; referred to enthronement day when the king became God\u0026rsquo;s vice-regent.\nNT Interpretation:\nHebrews 1:5; 5:5: Applied to Jesus\u0026rsquo; exaltation Romans 1:4: Jesus \u0026ldquo;declared to be Son of God in power\u0026hellip;by resurrection\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Begotten\u0026rdquo; (γεγέννηκα): Not ontological generation (Jesus was always Son) but declarative installation. The resurrection publicly declares what was always true.\nAcademic Footnotes \u0026amp; Bibliography\rTextual Criticism ¹ The shift from \u0026ldquo;Barnabas and Saul\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Paul and his companions\u0026rdquo; (Παῦλος δὲ καὶ οἱ περὶ αὐτόν) is noted by all major commentators as marking narrative transition.

On the Sabbath, Paul delivers his first recorded sermon—a masterful synthesis of Israel\u0026rsquo;s history demonstrating that Jesus fulfills God\u0026rsquo;s promises to David. The sermon traces God\u0026rsquo;s redemptive plan from the Exodus through David to Jesus, emphasizing that forgiveness comes through Christ alone. The response is initially enthusiastic, with many Jews and Gentiles believing. However, when nearly the entire city gathers the following Sabbath, Jewish leaders oppose Paul and Barnabas, prompting the apostles to formally announce their turn to the Gentiles, citing Isaiah 49:6. Despite persecution and expulsion, the disciples are filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.\u003c/p\u003e","title":""},{"content":"Genesis 1: In the Beginning God Introduction to the Chapter [To be filled: Overview of Genesis 1\u0026rsquo;s place in Scripture and theology]\nText Structure and Outline [To be filled: Literary analysis of the creation account structure]\nVerse-by-Verse Commentary Genesis 1:1 - The Foundation Statement [Link to detailed verse commentary already created]\nGenesis 1:2 - The Spirit Over the Waters [To be filled: Detailed exegesis of verse 2]\nGenesis 1:3-5 - Day One: Light [To be filled: Commentary on the creation of light]\nGenesis 1:6-8 - Day Two: The Expanse [To be filled: Commentary on the separation of waters]\nGenesis 1:9-13 - Day Three: Land and Vegetation [To be filled: Commentary on dry land and plant life]\nGenesis 1:14-19 - Day Four: Celestial Bodies [To be filled: Commentary on sun, moon, and stars]\nGenesis 1:20-23 - Day Five: Sea and Sky Life [To be filled: Commentary on fish and birds]\nGenesis 1:24-31 - Day Six: Land Animals and Humanity [To be filled: Commentary on land creatures and the image of God]\nTheological Themes Divine Sovereignty in Creation [To be filled: God\u0026rsquo;s absolute authority over creation]\nThe Image of God [To be filled: What it means to be made in God\u0026rsquo;s image]\nCreation Mandate [To be filled: Humanity\u0026rsquo;s role in creation]\nCreation and Sabbath [To be filled: The pattern of work and rest]\nContemporary Applications Science and Faith [To be filled: How Genesis 1 relates to modern scientific understanding]\nEnvironmental Stewardship [To be filled: Our responsibility for creation care]\nHuman Dignity [To be filled: Image of God and human worth]\nCross-References Related Passages: John 1:1-3; Colossians 1:16-17; Hebrews 11:3 Theological Connections: Creation Theology Practical Applications: Environmental Ethics Previous: Introduction to Genesis | Next: Genesis 2 | Book Overview: Genesis\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/commentary/old-testament/pentateuch/genesis/genesis-1/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"genesis-1-in-the-beginning-god\"\u003eGenesis 1: In the Beginning God\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"introduction-to-the-chapter\"\u003eIntroduction to the Chapter\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[To be filled: Overview of Genesis 1\u0026rsquo;s place in Scripture and theology]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"text-structure-and-outline\"\u003eText Structure and Outline\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[To be filled: Literary analysis of the creation account structure]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"verse-by-verse-commentary\"\u003eVerse-by-Verse Commentary\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"genesis-11---the-foundation-statement\"\u003eGenesis 1:1 - The Foundation Statement\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e[Link to detailed verse commentary already created]\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"genesis-12---the-spirit-over-the-waters\"\u003eGenesis 1:2 - The Spirit Over the Waters\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[To be filled: Detailed exegesis of verse 2]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"genesis-13-5---day-one-light\"\u003eGenesis 1:3-5 - Day One: Light\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[To be filled: Commentary on the creation of light]\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Genesis 1 - In the Beginning God"},{"content":"Genesis 1:1 - \u0026ldquo;In the Beginning God Created the Heavens and the Earth\u0026rdquo; Text and Translation Hebrew: בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים אֵת הַשָּׁמַיִם וְאֵת הָאָרֶץ\nTransliteration: Bereshit bara Elohim et hashamayim ve\u0026rsquo;et ha\u0026rsquo;aretz\nLiteral: \u0026ldquo;In beginning created God [object marker] the heavens and [object marker] the earth\u0026rdquo;\nExegetical Analysis \u0026ldquo;In the Beginning\u0026rdquo; (בְּרֵאשִׁית) The opening word establishes the temporal framework for all that follows. This is not merely a beginning, but the beginning—the absolute commencement of created reality. The Hebrew construct form links this beginning specifically to what God is about to do.\nTheological Significance: This phrase implies:\nA definite starting point for the created order The existence of God before creation (eternal pre-existence) The temporal nature of creation vs. the eternal nature of God \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo; (אֱלֹהִים) The Hebrew Elohim is grammatically plural but takes singular verbs throughout Genesis 1, suggesting majesty and fullness rather than plurality of beings. This is the first revelation of God\u0026rsquo;s name in Scripture.\nKey Insights:\nElohim emphasizes God\u0026rsquo;s power and authority The plural form may hint at the Trinity (though not explicitly revealed until the New Testament) This is God as Creator, not yet revealed in covenant relationship (Yahweh comes later) \u0026ldquo;Created\u0026rdquo; (בָּרָא) The verb bara is used exclusively of divine activity in the Old Testament. Humans never \u0026ldquo;bara\u0026rdquo;—only God creates in this absolute sense.\nTheological Implications:\nCreatio ex nihilo: Creation from nothing Divine sovereignty over all material reality Distinction between Creator and creation God\u0026rsquo;s creative activity is effortless and purposeful \u0026ldquo;The Heavens and the Earth\u0026rdquo; (הַשָּׁמַיִם וְאֵת הָאָרֶץ) This phrase represents a merism—a figure of speech where two opposites or extremes represent the totality. \u0026ldquo;Heavens and earth\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;everything that exists.\u0026rdquo;\nScope of Creation:\nThe entire cosmos, not just planet Earth All spiritual and material realms The complete created order in all its dimensions Theological Themes 1. Divine Sovereignty God is presented as the sovereign ruler who speaks reality into existence. There is no struggle, no resistance, no pre-existing materials that limit Him.\n2. Monotheism Against the backdrop of ancient Near Eastern polytheism, Genesis 1:1 declares that one God created everything. There are no competing deities.\n3. Creation\u0026rsquo;s Dependence Everything that exists depends entirely on God for its existence. The created order has no independent existence.\n4. God\u0026rsquo;s Transcendence and Immanence God exists before and beyond creation (transcendent) yet is actively involved in creating and sustaining it (immanent).\nHistorical and Literary Context Ancient Near Eastern Background Unlike other ancient creation accounts (Enuma Elish, etc.) that involve conflict between gods, Genesis presents creation as the purposeful act of one sovereign God.\nLiterary Structure Genesis 1:1 serves as:\nThe title statement for the entire creation account The theological thesis of the chapter The foundation for understanding humanity\u0026rsquo;s place in creation Contemporary Applications For Christian Worldview Scientific Engagement: Genesis 1:1 establishes that the universe had a beginning, consistent with Big Bang cosmology Environmental Stewardship: Recognizing God as Creator should inform our care for creation Human Dignity: Humans are created beings, not evolutionary accidents For Pastoral Ministry Comfort in Suffering: The same God who created everything is sovereign over our circumstances Worship: Creation calls forth praise to the Creator Mission: All nations are created by the same God and accountable to Him Cross-References Old Testament Psalm 33:6 - \u0026ldquo;By the word of the LORD the heavens were made\u0026rdquo; Isaiah 45:18 - \u0026ldquo;For thus says the LORD, who created the heavens\u0026rdquo; Nehemiah 9:6 - \u0026ldquo;You alone are the LORD. You made the heavens\u0026rdquo; New Testament John 1:1-3 - Christ as the agent of creation Colossians 1:16 - \u0026ldquo;By him all things were created\u0026rdquo; Hebrews 11:3 - \u0026ldquo;By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God\u0026rdquo; Questions for Further Study How does Genesis 1:1 address the philosophical question \u0026ldquo;Why is there something rather than nothing?\u0026rdquo; What does this verse teach us about the relationship between faith and science? How should the doctrine of creation ex nihilo shape our understanding of miracles? For Translation Considerations Key Translation Challenges Preserving the emphasis on God\u0026rsquo;s sovereignty Maintaining the cosmic scope (\u0026ldquo;heavens and earth\u0026rdquo;) Conveying the absolute nature of \u0026ldquo;beginning\u0026rdquo; Cultural Contextualization When translating into cultures with polytheistic backgrounds, special care should be taken to emphasize the monotheistic message and God\u0026rsquo;s absolute sovereignty over all creation.\nNext: Genesis 1:2 - The Spirit of God Hovering Over the Waters\nRelated Topics: Doctrine of Creation, Divine Attributes, Biblical Cosmology\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/commentary/genesis/genesis-1-1/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"genesis-11---in-the-beginning-god-created-the-heavens-and-the-earth\"\u003eGenesis 1:1 - \u0026ldquo;In the Beginning God Created the Heavens and the Earth\u0026rdquo;\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"text-and-translation\"\u003eText and Translation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHebrew\u003c/strong\u003e: בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים אֵת הַשָּׁמַיִם וְאֵת הָאָרֶץ\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTransliteration\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003cem\u003eBereshit bara Elohim et hashamayim ve\u0026rsquo;et ha\u0026rsquo;aretz\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eLiteral\u003c/strong\u003e: \u0026ldquo;In beginning created God [object marker] the heavens and [object marker] the earth\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"exegetical-analysis\"\u003eExegetical Analysis\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"in-the-beginning-בראשית\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;In the Beginning\u0026rdquo; (בְּרֵאשִׁית)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe opening word establishes the temporal framework for all that follows.

Unlike most of his letters, there\u0026rsquo;s no need to defend his apostleship or immediately correct serious errors. Instead, he expresses genuine thanksgiving for their partnership in the gospel ministry.\nKey themes in this opening:\nPartnership in ministry: The Philippians have been faithful supporters from the beginning God\u0026rsquo;s faithfulness: What God starts, He finishes (v. 6) Spiritual growth: Paul prays for their love to increase with wisdom and discernment Gospel focus: Everything centers on advancing and defending the gospel This passage sets the tone for the entire letter: joyful, affectionate, gospel-centered, and forward-looking. Paul\u0026rsquo;s confidence isn\u0026rsquo;t in the Philippians\u0026rsquo; abilities but in God\u0026rsquo;s faithfulness to complete His work in them.\nVerse-by-Verse Analysis\rVerses 1-2: Greeting \u0026ldquo;Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus\u0026rdquo;\nUnlike many letters where Paul emphasizes his apostolic authority (e.g., Romans, Galatians), here he identifies himself and Timothy simply as δοῦλοι douloi\nslaves/servants\nStrong\u0026rsquo;s: G1401 .

Understanding who God is—His essential nature and perfections—shapes every other aspect of Christian doctrine and practice.\nDefinition of Divine Attributes Divine attributes are the perfections or qualities that belong to God\u0026rsquo;s essential nature. They are not additions to God\u0026rsquo;s being but are identical with His essence. God does not have attributes; rather, God is His attributes.\nClassification of Divine Attributes Incommunicable Attributes These attributes belong to God alone and are not shared with creatures in any degree.\n1. Aseity (Self-Existence) Definition: God exists by the necessity of His own nature Biblical Foundation: Exodus 3:14 (\u0026ldquo;I AM WHO I AM\u0026rdquo;); John 5:26 Theological Significance: God is dependent on nothing outside Himself Practical Application: Provides ultimate security and foundation for faith 2. Immutability (Unchangeableness) Definition: God does not change in His being, perfections, purposes, or promises Biblical Foundation: Malachi 3:6; James 1:17; Hebrews 13:8 Theological Significance: God\u0026rsquo;s faithfulness and reliability Common Misconceptions: Addressing apparent contradictions (God \u0026ldquo;repenting\u0026rdquo;) 3. Eternity Definition: God transcends all temporal limitations Biblical Foundation: Psalm 90:2; Isaiah 57:15; 2 Peter 3:8 Two Aspects: Duration without beginning or end Transcendence over temporal succession Practical Application: Comfort in God\u0026rsquo;s eternal perspective 4. Immensity and Omnipresence Definition: God transcends all spatial limitations while being present everywhere Biblical Foundation: 1 Kings 8:27; Psalm 139:7-10; Jeremiah 23:23-24 Distinction: Immensity (transcendence) vs. Omnipresence (immanence) Pastoral Implications: God\u0026rsquo;s nearness in suffering, accountability in all places 5. Simplicity Definition: God is not composed of parts but is absolutely simple Theological Importance: Guards against viewing God as a complex being Implications: God\u0026rsquo;s attributes are not separate qualities but aspects of His unified essence Contemporary Relevance: Addresses modern philosophical challenges Communicable Attributes These attributes are shared with creatures in a finite, limited way.\n1. Omniscience (All-Knowing) Definition: God knows all things actual and possible, past, present, and future Biblical Foundation: Psalm 147:5; Isaiah 46:9-10; 1 John 3:20 Scope of Divine Knowledge: Propositional knowledge (facts) Experiential knowledge (relational) Foreknowledge (future events) Theological Debates: Relationship to human freedom, open theism 2. Omnipotence (All-Powerful) Definition: God has power to do all that is consistent with His nature Biblical Foundation: Genesis 17:1; Matthew 19:26; Revelation 19:6 Limitations: God cannot contradict His nature (lie, sin, cease to exist) Applications: Confidence in prayer, hope in impossible situations 3. Wisdom Definition: God\u0026rsquo;s perfect knowledge applied to achieve the best possible ends Biblical Foundation: Romans 11:33; 1 Corinthians 1:24; Ephesians 3:10 Relationship to Knowledge: Wisdom as the right use of omniscience Practical Comfort: Trust in God\u0026rsquo;s perfect planning 4. Righteousness and Justice Definition: God\u0026rsquo;s conformity to His own perfect standard and His fair treatment of all Biblical Foundation: Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 119:137; Romans 3:26 Aspects: Internal righteousness (moral perfection) External justice (fair dealings) Rectoral justice (as moral governor) 5. Holiness Definition: God\u0026rsquo;s absolute moral purity and separation from all sin Biblical Foundation: Isaiah 6:3; 1 Peter 1:16; Revelation 4:8 Two Aspects: Moral holiness (ethical purity) Metaphysical holiness (otherness) Implications: Need for atonement, call to sanctification 6. Love Definition: God\u0026rsquo;s eternal, perfect benevolence toward His creation Biblical Foundation: 1 John 4:8, 16; John 3:16; Romans 5:8 Types of Divine Love: General love (all creation) Special love (elect) Trinitarian love (within Godhead) 7. Mercy and Grace Mercy: God\u0026rsquo;s compassion toward those in misery Grace: God\u0026rsquo;s favor toward the undeserving Biblical Foundation: Exodus 34:6-7; Ephesians 2:4-5 Relationship: Both flow from God\u0026rsquo;s love The Unity of Divine Attributes Important Principles No Hierarchy: No attribute is more important than others Perfect Harmony: All attributes work together perfectly Essential Unity: Attributes are not separate components but unified perfections Practical Implications God\u0026rsquo;s justice does not contradict His mercy God\u0026rsquo;s sovereignty does not negate His love God\u0026rsquo;s transcendence does not compromise His immanence Contemporary Applications For Worship Understanding God\u0026rsquo;s attributes should lead to:\nAwe and reverence (holiness, majesty) Confidence and trust (faithfulness, power) Gratitude and praise (love, mercy) For Christian Living Assurance: Based on God\u0026rsquo;s unchanging character Prayer: Confidence in God\u0026rsquo;s ability and willingness to hear Ethics: Conformity to God\u0026rsquo;s moral character Evangelism: Sharing the good news of God\u0026rsquo;s grace For Pastoral Ministry Counseling: Applying appropriate attributes to specific situations Preaching: Ensuring balanced presentation of God\u0026rsquo;s character Discipleship: Growing in understanding and experience of God Common Errors to Avoid 1. Anthropomorphism Error: Making God too much like humans Correction: Maintaining proper distinction between Creator and creature 2. Deism Error: Emphasizing transcendence at expense of immanence Correction: Balanced view of God\u0026rsquo;s nearness and otherness 3. Pantheism Error: Identifying God with creation Correction: Maintaining Creator-creature distinction 4. Reducing God to Single Attribute Error: Overemphasizing one attribute (e.g., only love, only wrath) Correction: Comprehensive view of God\u0026rsquo;s unified character Discussion Questions How does understanding God\u0026rsquo;s immutability provide comfort in times of change? What is the relationship between God\u0026rsquo;s justice and mercy in salvation? How should the doctrine of divine omniscience affect our prayer life? In what ways do God\u0026rsquo;s communicable attributes serve as a model for Christian character?
