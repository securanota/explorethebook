# Personal Statement: A Call to Freely Give Biblical Truth

## My Conviction

After years of study, research, and reflection on Scripture, I have become increasingly convinced that the commercialization of biblical teaching and theological resources fundamentally contradicts Christ's clear command: "Freely you received, freely give" (Matthew 10:8). The Word of God, given freely to humanity through Christ, should not be locked behind paywalls, restricted by copyright, or sold for profit.

## The Biblical Foundation

Scripture is unambiguous about this principle:

- **Christ's Command**: "Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you received, freely give" (Matthew 10:8)
- **Paul's Example**: "Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, as those sent from God" (2 Corinthians 2:17)
- **The Temple Cleansing**: Jesus drove out those who sold in the temple, declaring "My house will be called a house of prayer" (Matthew 21:13)

The pattern throughout Scripture is clear: spiritual truth and biblical instruction should be given freely, while legitimate ministry work should be supported through voluntary giving, not through the sale of spiritual content.

## My Vision for Explore The Book

God has blessed me with:
- Years of theological study and research
- A substantial theological library
- Experience in biblical exegesis and teaching
- Skills in writing and content creation

Rather than monetizing these gifts through book sales, courses, or subscription services, I believe God is calling me to freely give what I have freely received. My vision for explorethebook.com is to create a comprehensive, freely available resource that includes:

### Core Commitments

1. **Completely Free Access**: No paywalls, subscriptions, or payment requirements
2. **Open Content**: All materials released under public domain or permissive licenses
3. **Global Accessibility**: Content designed for translation into major world languages
4. **Low-Tech Approach**: Simple, fast-loading static website accessible even in low-bandwidth areas
5. **Biblical Fidelity**: Commitment to careful exegesis and theological accuracy

### The Mission

To provide the global church with:
- **Comprehensive Biblical Commentary**: Verse-by-verse exposition of every book of the Bible
- **Theological Resources**: Articles covering systematic theology, biblical theology, and practical theology
- **Educational Courses**: Basic theological education to equip pastors and teachers worldwide
- **Pastoral Tools**: Resources for preaching, teaching, and discipleship

## Why This Matters

In our interconnected world, many faithful pastors and Christian workers in developing nations lack access to quality biblical resources due to financial constraints. Meanwhile, in affluent nations, the commercialization of Christian content often creates barriers to deep biblical study and theological education.

By freely providing these resources, we can:
- **Equip the Global Church**: Provide tools for faithful Bible teaching worldwide
- **Remove Financial Barriers**: Ensure economic status never limits access to biblical truth
- **Model Biblical Principles**: Demonstrate what it means to freely give what we've freely received
- **Enable Translation**: Allow content to be adapted and translated without legal restrictions

## The Technology Choice

Using a static website built from Markdown files ensures:
- **Sustainability**: Low hosting costs and minimal maintenance
- **Accessibility**: Fast loading even on slow internet connections
- **Preservation**: Content remains accessible and transferable
- **Collaboration**: Easy for others to contribute translations and improvements
- **Simplicity**: Focus remains on content, not technology

## A Personal Commitment

This is not merely an idealistic vision but a personal commitment rooted in biblical conviction. I believe that those who have been entrusted with understanding God's Word have a responsibility to share that understanding freely, just as Christ freely shared His life and truth with us.

The early church fathers, the Reformers, and countless faithful teachers throughout history have provided their theological insights freely. In our digital age, we have unprecedented opportunities to continue this tradition on a global scale.

## The Call to Action

I invite others who share this conviction to join in this missionâ€”whether through contributing content, translating materials, providing technical support, or simply spreading the word about these freely available resources.

Together, we can build a comprehensive biblical and theological library that serves the global church without commercial barriers, demonstrating practically what it means to freely give what we have freely received.
