# About Explore The Book

## Our Mission

> "Freely you received, freely give." (Matthew 10:8)

Explore The Book exists to provide comprehensive biblical and theological resources freely to the global church, removing financial barriers to quality theological education and sound biblical teaching.

## Our Vision

We envision a world where every pastor, teacher, and Christian worker has access to:
- **Comprehensive biblical commentary** on every book of the Bible
- **Sound theological education** covering all major doctrines
- **Practical ministry resources** for effective Christian service
- **Quality translations** in major world languages

All provided **completely free** and released to the **public domain**.

## Our Conviction

We are deeply convinced that the commercialization of biblical teaching and theological resources contradicts Scripture's clear teaching. Christ commanded His disciples to "freely give" what they had "freely received" (Matthew 10:8). Paul condemned those who "peddle the word of God for profit" (2 Corinthians 2:17).

Following this biblical principle, we believe that:
- God's Word should not be sold for profit
- Theological education should be accessible regardless of economic status
- Biblical resources should be freely shared, translated, and adapted
- The church worldwide benefits when knowledge is freely exchanged

## Our Approach

### Theological Foundation

## Our Statement of Faith

We affirm the essential truths of evangelical Christianity:

### Scripture
We believe the Bible, consisting of the Old and New Testaments, is the inspired, infallible, and inerrant Word of God, our final authority for faith and practice.

### God
We believe in one God, eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

### Jesus Christ
We believe Jesus Christ is fully God and fully man, born of a virgin, who lived a sinless life, died as a substitute for sinners, rose bodily from the dead, and will return in glory.

### Salvation
We believe salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, apart from works, and is available to all who believe.

### The Church
We believe in the universal church, consisting of all true believers, called to worship, fellowship, discipleship, and mission.

### Last Things
We believe in the personal return of Christ, the resurrection of the dead, and the final judgment leading to eternal life or eternal punishment.
