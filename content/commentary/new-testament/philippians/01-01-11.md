## Passage Text (ESV)

> **¹** Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus,
> To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons:
> **²** Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
> 
> **³** I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, **⁴** always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy, **⁵** because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now. **⁶** And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. **⁷** It is right for me to feel this way about you all, because I hold you in my heart, for you are all partakers with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel. **⁸** For God is my witness, how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus. **⁹** And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, **¹⁰** so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, **¹¹** filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.

## Quick Insights

Paul opens his letter to the Philippians with warmth and pastoral affection. Unlike most of his letters, there's no need to defend his apostleship or immediately correct serious errors. Instead, he expresses genuine thanksgiving for their partnership in the gospel ministry.

**Key themes in this opening:**
- **Partnership in ministry**: The Philippians have been faithful supporters from the beginning
- **God's faithfulness**: What God starts, He finishes (v. 6)
- **Spiritual growth**: Paul prays for their love to increase with wisdom and discernment
- **Gospel focus**: Everything centers on advancing and defending the gospel

This passage sets the tone for the entire letter: joyful, affectionate, gospel-centered, and forward-looking. Paul's confidence isn't in the Philippians' abilities but in God's faithfulness to complete His work in them.

### Verses 1-2: Greeting

**"Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus"**

Unlike many letters where Paul emphasizes his apostolic authority (e.g., Romans, Galatians), here he identifies himself and Timothy simply as {{< greek "δοῦλοι" "douloi" "G1401" "slaves/servants" >}}. This term indicates complete devotion and submission to Christ's lordship.

**"To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi"**

- **"Saints"** ({{< greek "ἁγίοις" "hagiois" "G40" "holy ones" >}}): Not moral perfection but set-apart status for God's purposes
- **"In Christ Jesus"**: The fundamental position of every believer - union with Christ
- **"At Philippi"**: Physical location doesn't change spiritual identity

**"with the overseers and deacons"**

This is the only Pauline letter that specifically addresses church leaders in the greeting.

### Verses 3-6: Thanksgiving for Partnership

**"I thank my God in all my remembrance of you"**

Paul's gratitude is directed to God as the source of everything good in the Philippians. The phrase suggests ongoing, habitual thanksgiving.

**"because of your partnership in the gospel"**

The word **"partnership"** ({{< greek "κοινωνίᾳ" "koinonia" "G2842" >}}) is rich in meaning:
- Shared participation
- Active cooperation
- Financial support (as used in 4:15-16)
- Spiritual communion

**"And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion"**

This is one of the most encouraging verses in Scripture for believers worried about perseverance:

- **"I am sure"** ({{< greek "πεποιθὼς" "pepoithōs" "G3982" >}}): Perfect tense = settled, permanent confidence
- **"He who began"**: God is the initiator of salvation
- **"Will bring it to completion"** ({{< greek "ἐπιτελέσει" "epitelesei" "G2005" >}}): Future indicative = absolute certainty
