## Overview
The book of Acts, also known as the Acts of the Apostles, is a historical narrative that chronicles the birth and early expansion of the Christian church. Written by Luke as a sequel to his Gospel, Acts traces the spread of Christianity from Jerusalem to Rome, emphasizing the work of the Holy Spirit through the apostles, particularly Peter and Paul.

## Authorship and Date
Acts was written by Luke, the physician and companion of Paul, likely between AD 60-85. The book serves as the second volume of Luke's two-part work, with the Gospel of Luke being the first. Luke's careful attention to historical detail and his firsthand knowledge of many events make Acts an invaluable historical document.

## Structure
Acts can be divided into two main sections:
- **Chapters 1-12**: Focus on the ministry of Peter and the early church in Jerusalem and Judea
- **Chapters 13-28**: Focus on Paul's missionary journeys and the expansion of the church to the Gentile world

The book follows a geographical progression outlined in Acts 1:8: "Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth."

## Key Themes
- **Holy Spirit**: The empowering presence of the Holy Spirit is central to every major advancement in the early church
- **Evangelism**: The bold proclamation of the gospel despite opposition and persecution
- **Church Growth**: The numerical and geographical expansion of the Christian community
- **Cultural Bridge-Building**: The transition from a Jewish sect to a universal faith including Gentiles
- **Suffering and Persecution**: The cost of discipleship and the church's response to opposition
- **Prayer**: The vital role of prayer in the life and mission of the early church

## Historical Context
Acts covers approximately 30 years (AD 30-60) of early church history, beginning with Jesus' ascension and ending with Paul's imprisonment in Rome. The book provides crucial historical context for understanding the political, cultural, and religious environment in which Christianity first spread throughout the Roman Empire.
