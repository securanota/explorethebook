# The Doctrine of God: Divine Attributes

## Introduction

The study of God's attributes forms the foundation of all theological reflection. Understanding who God is—His essential nature and perfections—shapes every other aspect of Christian doctrine and practice.

## Definition of Divine Attributes

Divine attributes are the perfections or qualities that belong to God's essential nature. They are not additions to God's being but are identical with His essence. God does not *have* attributes; rather, God *is* His attributes.

## Classification of Divine Attributes

### Incommunicable Attributes
These attributes belong to God alone and are not shared with creatures in any degree.

#### 1. **Aseity (Self-Existence)**
- **Definition**: God exists by the necessity of His own nature
- **Biblical Foundation**: Exodus 3:14 ("I AM WHO I AM"); John 5:26
- **Theological Significance**: God is dependent on nothing outside Himself
- **Practical Application**: Provides ultimate security and foundation for faith

#### 2. **Immutability (Unchangeableness)**
- **Definition**: God does not change in His being, perfections, purposes, or promises
- **Biblical Foundation**: Malachi 3:6; James 1:17; Hebrews 13:8
- **Theological Significance**: God's faithfulness and reliability
- **Common Misconceptions**: Addressing apparent contradictions (God "repenting")

#### 3. **Eternity**
- **Definition**: God transcends all temporal limitations
- **Biblical Foundation**: Psalm 90:2; Isaiah 57:15; 2 Peter 3:8
- **Two Aspects**: 
  - Duration without beginning or end
  - Transcendence over temporal succession
- **Practical Application**: Comfort in God's eternal perspective

#### 4. **Immensity and Omnipresence**
- **Definition**: God transcends all spatial limitations while being present everywhere
- **Biblical Foundation**: 1 Kings 8:27; Psalm 139:7-10; Jeremiah 23:23-24
- **Distinction**: Immensity (transcendence) vs. Omnipresence (immanence)
- **Pastoral Implications**: God's nearness in suffering, accountability in all places

#### 5. **Simplicity**
- **Definition**: God is not composed of parts but is absolutely simple
- **Theological Importance**: Guards against viewing God as a complex being
- **Implications**: God's attributes are not separate qualities but aspects of His unified essence
- **Contemporary Relevance**: Addresses modern philosophical challenges

### Communicable Attributes
These attributes are shared with creatures in a finite, limited way.

#### 1. **Omniscience (All-Knowing)**
- **Definition**: God knows all things actual and possible, past, present, and future
- **Biblical Foundation**: Psalm 147:5; Isaiah 46:9-10; 1 John 3:20
- **Scope of Divine Knowledge**:
  - Propositional knowledge (facts)
  - Experiential knowledge (relational)
  - Foreknowledge (future events)
- **Theological Debates**: Relationship to human freedom, open theism

#### 2. **Omnipotence (All-Powerful)**
- **Definition**: God has power to do all that is consistent with His nature
- **Biblical Foundation**: Genesis 17:1; Matthew 19:26; Revelation 19:6
- **Limitations**: God cannot contradict His nature (lie, sin, cease to exist)
- **Applications**: Confidence in prayer, hope in impossible situations

#### 3. **Wisdom**
- **Definition**: God's perfect knowledge applied to achieve the best possible ends
- **Biblical Foundation**: Romans 11:33; 1 Corinthians 1:24; Ephesians 3:10
- **Relationship to Knowledge**: Wisdom as the right use of omniscience
- **Practical Comfort**: Trust in God's perfect planning

#### 4. **Righteousness and Justice**
- **Definition**: God's conformity to His own perfect standard and His fair treatment of all
- **Biblical Foundation**: Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 119:137; Romans 3:26
- **Aspects**:
  - Internal righteousness (moral perfection)
  - External justice (fair dealings)
  - Rectoral justice (as moral governor)

#### 5. **Holiness**
- **Definition**: God's absolute moral purity and separation from all sin
- **Biblical Foundation**: Isaiah 6:3; 1 Peter 1:16; Revelation 4:8
- **Two Aspects**:
  - Moral holiness (ethical purity)
  - Metaphysical holiness (otherness)
- **Implications**: Need for atonement, call to sanctification

#### 6. **Love**
- **Definition**: God's eternal, perfect benevolence toward His creation
- **Biblical Foundation**: 1 John 4:8, 16; John 3:16; Romans 5:8
- **Types of Divine Love**:
  - General love (all creation)
  - Special love (elect)
  - Trinitarian love (within Godhead)

#### 7. **Mercy and Grace**
- **Mercy**: God's compassion toward those in misery
- **Grace**: God's favor toward the undeserving
- **Biblical Foundation**: Exodus 34:6-7; Ephesians 2:4-5
- **Relationship**: Both flow from God's love

## The Unity of Divine Attributes

### Important Principles
1. **No Hierarchy**: No attribute is more important than others
2. **Perfect Harmony**: All attributes work together perfectly
3. **Essential Unity**: Attributes are not separate components but unified perfections

### Practical Implications
- God's justice does not contradict His mercy
- God's sovereignty does not negate His love
- God's transcendence does not compromise His immanence

## Contemporary Applications

### For Worship
Understanding God's attributes should lead to:
- Awe and reverence (holiness, majesty)
- Confidence and trust (faithfulness, power)
- Gratitude and praise (love, mercy)

### For Christian Living
- **Assurance**: Based on God's unchanging character
- **Prayer**: Confidence in God's ability and willingness to hear
- **Ethics**: Conformity to God's moral character
- **Evangelism**: Sharing the good news of God's grace

### For Pastoral Ministry
- **Counseling**: Applying appropriate attributes to specific situations
- **Preaching**: Ensuring balanced presentation of God's character
- **Discipleship**: Growing in understanding and experience of God

## Common Errors to Avoid

### 1. **Anthropomorphism**
- Error: Making God too much like humans
- Correction: Maintaining proper distinction between Creator and creature

### 2. **Deism**
- Error: Emphasizing transcendence at expense of immanence
- Correction: Balanced view of God's nearness and otherness

### 3. **Pantheism**
- Error: Identifying God with creation
- Correction: Maintaining Creator-creature distinction

### 4. **Reducing God to Single Attribute**
- Error: Overemphasizing one attribute (e.g., only love, only wrath)
- Correction: Comprehensive view of God's unified character

## Discussion Questions

1. How does understanding God's immutability provide comfort in times of change?
2. What is the relationship between God's justice and mercy in salvation?
3. How should the doctrine of divine omniscience affect our prayer life?
4. In what ways do God's communicable attributes serve as a model for Christian character?
