# The Doctrine of God (Theology Proper)

## Introduction
The study of God Himself—His nature, attributes, and works—forms the foundation of all theological knowledge.

## Core Articles in This Section

### God's Nature and Being
- [Divine Attributes](divine-attributes.md) - God's perfections and qualities
- [Divine Simplicity](divine-simplicity.md) - God's unity and indivisibility
- [The Trinity](trinity.md) - One God in three persons
- [Divine Immanence and Transcendence](immanence-transcendence.md) - God's nearness and otherness

### God's Works
- [Creation](creation.md) - God's creative work and purpose
- [Providence](providence.md) - God's sustaining and governing of creation
- [Divine Decrees](divine-decrees.md) - God's eternal purposes and plans
- [Miracles](miracles.md) - God's extraordinary works in history

### God's Revelation

- [The Names of God](names-of-god.md) - How God reveals Himself through His names

## Study Sequence
For systematic study, we recommend this order:
1. Divine Attributes (foundational understanding)
2. Trinity (essential Christian doctrine)
3. Creation (God's first work)
4. Providence (God's ongoing work)
5. General and Special Revelation (how we know God)

## Contemporary Relevance
Understanding God correctly affects:
- **Worship**: Proper response to who God is
- **Prayer**: Confidence in God's character
- **Suffering**: Trust in God's sovereignty and goodness
- **Ethics**: Living according to God's nature
- **Evangelism**: Proclaiming the true God
