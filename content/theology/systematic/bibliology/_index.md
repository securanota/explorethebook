## Study Sequence
For foundational understanding, we recommend this order:

2. Authority (why Scripture commands belief)
3. Inerrancy (Scripture's truthfulness)
4. Canon (which books belong)
5. Hermeneutics (how to interpret)

- **Theology**: Foundation for all doctrinal formulation
- **Preaching**: Confidence in proclaiming God's Word
- **Christian Living**: Guidance for faith and practice
- **Apologetics**: Defense of Christian truth claims
- **Mission**: Authority for global evangelization

## Common Errors to Avoid
